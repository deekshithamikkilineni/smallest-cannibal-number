# smallest-cannibal-number
 
A number is a cannibal number, if there are no two contiguous 1's in the binary represen is 101) is a cannibal number, but 6(whose binary representation is 110) is not a cannibal number. 
Given a number k, write a function to determine the smallest cannibal number which greater than or equal to 'k'. 

For Example: 
if k-6 (binary representation is 110) 
Then, the output should be 8 (whose binary representation is 1000). 

Input Specification : (This has been implemented) 
Input being fetched from the command line arguments. The only argument is an integer k. 

Output Specification : (This has been implemented) 
Output be the smallest cannibal number which is greater than or equal to k. 

Function Specification: 
This form on should return the smallest cannibal number which greater than or equal to k. Consider the size of integer to be a bit Assure value of k is such that "the smallest cannibal number which greater than or equal to k" always exist

Sample Input: 
6

Sample Output:
8
